# Getting-started

## 2019-12-19

Today I'm starting this whole thing as a [vacation](https://i.chzbgr.com/original/7876465408/hD3CCA60A/) project.

I've just created this repo to help me to stay focused on what I'm doing and as a way to improve my productivity.

Read:
* (MyStory: How I became a Data Science Analyst from a Software developer?)[https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/mystory-how-i-became-data-science-analyst-from-software-developer/]
* (Should I become a data scientist (or a business analyst)?)[https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/09/become-data-scientist-business-analyst/]

Talked to a friend of mine about this vacation project and if it's desirable to have a master degree on CS/Statistics and about future plans. Right now, I can't help myself but to feel overwhelmed with all the things caught in my mind, all the things all have to go through to "get there". Will I make it? To be fair, I do have the opportunity and I'm in a very good position to do this. I can do this. Will I though?

Studied the following content:
* [Absolute Deviation Demonstration](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/summarizing_distributions/median_sim.html)
* [Squared Differences Demonstration](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/summarizing_distributions/mean_sq_sim.html)
* [Balance Scale Demonstration](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/summarizing_distributions/balance.html)

I'm really getting the feeling that I should plan this thing better. The content I just saw it ok, but too entry-level. I'm kind of leaning towards a book a approach maybe, because the course to follow is clearer.

Starting to take a look at this book: [Introduction to Probability, Statistics, and Random Processes](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/)

Yesterday I've got to review some stuff of sets and read the preface of [Introduction to Probability, Statistics, and Random Processes](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/). So today I plan to continue studying this book. Guess I'm also going to keep my notebook at hand for some note keeping and for drafting some ideas.


Solved a problem of sets cardinality.

Some theorems on sets countability.

Useful definitions from the book:
>_Outcome: A result of a random experiment._
>_Sample Space: The set of all possible outcomes._
>_Event: A subset of the sample space._
